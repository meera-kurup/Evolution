Final Project CSCI0150

Evolution is the final project for the introductory CS course, CSCI 0150. There are two parts to this Final Project. 

On the menu screen, there are two buttons: one to play the game Flappy Bird and another to play Evolution. 

FlappyBird is a videogame developed in 2013 where a bird must jump through pipes that move at a constant rate. The bird 
accelerates downwards due to gravity and jumps when the user presses the spacebar.

Evolution is a version of Flappy Bird where 50 birds, through Neuroevolution, learn to play the game. Using a neural network, 
the population of birds will decide when to jump. 

For a more detailed explanation about the learning algorithm, please read the Evolution write-up PDF.
